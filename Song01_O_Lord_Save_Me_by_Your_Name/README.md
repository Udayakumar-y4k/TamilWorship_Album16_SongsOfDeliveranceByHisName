# O Lord, Save Me by Your Name - கர்த்தரே உமது நாமத்தினால் என்னை இரட்சியும்

This song of bold petition and confident praise echoes Psalm 54 — “O God, save me by Your name, and vindicate me by Your might… Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life.” It is a cry for deliverance by His name amid enemies, trusting His justice and help. In the eternal day, this deliverance is complete — no more foes, only eternal safety in His name (Revelation 3:12).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, whose name is our salvation and strength,
thank You for saving and vindicating us by Your mighty name.
Hear our cries, uphold us in trouble, repay evil with justice.
In the eternal day, let us praise Your name forever.
Come quickly, our Savior and Helper.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
