# Give Me Wings Like a Dove - புறாவைப்போல் சிறகுகளை தாருங்கப்பா

This song of tender longing and childlike trust echoes Psalm 55 — “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest… Cast your burden on the Lord, and He will sustain you.” It is a cry for escape from oppression and rest in the Father’s arms, trusting His deliverance. In the eternal day, this longing is fulfilled — no more enemies, no more trembling, only perfect rest with the Lamb (Revelation 14:13).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, our Father who hears every cry,
thank You for giving wings like a dove to fly to Your rest.
Hear our prayers, deliver us from fear and oppression.
In the eternal day, let us rest in Your arms forever.
Come quickly, our Father and Rest.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
