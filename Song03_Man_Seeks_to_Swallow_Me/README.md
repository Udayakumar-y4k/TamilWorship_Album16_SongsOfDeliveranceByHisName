# Man Seeks to Swallow Me - மனுஷன் என்னை விழுங்கப் பார்க்கிறான்

This song of defiant trust and triumphant praise echoes Psalm 56 — “Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me; all day long an attacker oppresses me… When I am afraid, I put my trust in you. In God, whose word I praise… This I know, that God is for me.” It confronts the oppressor while affirming God’s nearness, counting tears, and ultimate deliverance. In the eternal day, this trust is perfected — no more trampling, only eternal safety and praise in His presence (Revelation 21:4).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, our refuge when man seeks to swallow us,
thank You for numbering our wanderings and bottling our tears.
When enemies rise, let us praise Your word and trust in You.
In the eternal day, let us stand fearless in Your presence forever.
Come quickly, our Deliverer and Trust.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
