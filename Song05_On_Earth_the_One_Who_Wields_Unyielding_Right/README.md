# On Earth the One Who Wields Unyielding Right - பூமியிலே நியாயம் செய்கிற தேவன் ஒருவரே

This song of bold declaration and divine justice echoes Psalm 58 — “Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? … Surely there is a God who judges on earth.” It confronts the wicked who twist justice and boast in evil, while affirming the Lord as the one true Judge who breaks their power. In the eternal day, this justice is perfected — no more wicked, only eternal righteousness in the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:27).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, righteous Judge of all the earth,
thank You for being the one true God who wields unyielding right.
Break the power of the wicked, shatter their fangs of deceit.
Let the righteous rejoice in Your justice and truth.
In the eternal day, let us dwell in Your righteous kingdom forever.
Come quickly, our Just King.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
