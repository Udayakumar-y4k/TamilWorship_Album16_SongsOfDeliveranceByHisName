# At Morning's First Blush - காலையிலே உம் கிருபையை மகிழ்ந்து புகழுவேன்

This song of morning praise and divine justice echoes Psalm 59 — “Deliver me from my enemies, O my God… But I will sing of Your strength; I will sing aloud of Your steadfast love in the morning. For You have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress.” It is a bold declaration of trust amid oppression, choosing praise and refuge in God. In the eternal day, this praise is perfected — no more enemies, only eternal morning joy in Zion with the Lamb (Revelation 22:5).
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, our morning mercy and eternal fortress,
thank You for being our refuge in trouble and our strength in praise.
Awaken our hearts each dawn to sing Your steadfast love.
In the eternal day, let us rejoice in Your city forever.
Come quickly, our Refuge and Morning Star.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
